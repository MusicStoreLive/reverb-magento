{"name":"Magento","tagline":"","body":"# Reverb Magento Sample Integration\r\n\r\nThis is a demo application for integrating with Reverb's API. It is not to be\r\nconsidered a fully functional app.\r\n\r\nSince there are many different magento versions and installations out there, we\r\nhope that by providing this sample integration, shops can customize it as\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n## What's working\r\n\r\nCurrently this extension syncs inventory from Magento to Reverb based on SKU.\r\nIt will also create new listings on Reverb if the SKU is not found.\r\n\r\nThe result of the sync is logged to a sync log available from the settings screen.\r\n\r\nOnly simple products are synced. Configurable products are not synced.\r\n\r\n## What's not working\r\n\r\n* Syncing configurable products\r\n* Syncing images from magento to Reverb\r\n* Syncing inventory (decrements/increments) from Reverb to Magneto [using webhooks](https://reverb.com/page/api#webhooks)\r\n* Order syncing from Reverb to Magento\r\n* Category mapping - from Magento categories to Reverb categories\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Copy everything from the app folder into your magento app\r\ncp -R app/* /path/to/magento/htdocs/app/\r\n# Clear your cache\r\nrm -rf /path/to/magento/htdocs/var/cache\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it\r\n2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)\r\n3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)\r\n4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)\r\n5.
